[Pronoun Drop](#language1)
--------------------------

**1PS**: Number of First Personal Pronoun. 1 indicates multiples 1PS, 0

**Pronoun drop**: it indicates if the language almost always requires a
1PS pronoun in an independent clause or not. 1 indicates that the
pronoun drop is NOT allowed, zero other

[Latitude](#latitude)
---------------------

**Latitude**: the absolute value of latitude in degrees divided by 90 to
place it on a 0 to 1 scale. The latitude of each country was obtained
from the Global Demography Project at U.C. Santa Barbara
(<a href="http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/gpw/globldem.doc.html" class="uri">http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/gpw/globldem.doc.html</a>),
discussed by Tobler, Deichmann, Gottsegen and Maloy (1995). These
location data correspond to the center of the county or province within
a country that contains the largest number of people

---------------------------

**Temperature\_Celcius**: Average daytime temperature of the country’s
capital city

[Settler Mortality](#mortality)
-------------------------------

**Settler\_Mortality\_Estimate** Mortality is potential settler
mortality, measured in terms of deaths per annum per 1,000 “mean
strength” (raw mortality numbers are adjusted to what they would be if a
force of 1,000 living people were kept in place for a whole year, e.g.,
it is possible for this number to exceed 1,000 in episodes of extreme
mortality as those who die are replaced with new arrivals). Sources and
methods for mortality are described in Section III, subsection B, and in
the unpublished Appendix (available from the authors; or see Acemoglu et
al., 2000)
